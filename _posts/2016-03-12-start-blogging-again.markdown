Yes, again. 

Back to year 2010-2011, I was really fascinated by my first smart phone Samsung i8320 which is based on limo platform. 
At that time C++ people were frustrated by the fact that android platform only support java API, and they liked the fact that limo is the one prospective open platform which supports native c++ development. 
And I'm one of them. So I made several apps on my phone and blogged about two of these projects in csdn [http://blog.csdn.net/higherone][old-blog] (in Chinese).

Now my interest moves into `big data analysis` and `distributed computing`. While learning and experimenting on these small projects, I'll try to blog them here. 

Comments are welcomed.
